title: Presence
description: API docs for deepstream's presence feature, allowing clients to know about other connected clients
---

Presence allows clients to know when other clients come online and offline, as well as the ability to query for connected clients.

It's worth mentioning that presence only shows clients that logged in with a username. For example, `client.login();` won't trigger the callback client.subscribe( callback ).

## Methods

### client.subscribe( callback )
{{#table mode="api"}}
-
  arg: callback
  typ: Function
  opt: false
  des: Will be invoked with the username of a client,
       and a boolean to indicate if it was a login(true) or
       logout(false) event
{{/table}}

Subscribes to presence events. Callback will receive the username of the newly added client

```javascript
// Client A
client.presence.subscribe((username, isLoggedIn) => {
  // handle new user
})

// Client B
client.login({username: 'Alex'})
```

### client.unsubscribe( callback )
{{#table mode="api"}}
-
  arg: callback
  typ: Function
  opt: False
  des: A previously registered callback
{{/table}}

Removes a previously registered presence callback

```javascript
function onOnlineStatusChange( username, isOnline ) {
  //...
}
// Client A
client.presence.subscribe( onOnlineStatusChange )
client.presence.unsubscribe( onOnlineStatusChange )
```

### client.getAll( callback )
{{#table mode="api"}}
-
  arg: callback
  typ: Function
  opt: False
  des: A function that will be called with an array of usernames that are online
{{/table}}

Queries for currently connected clients

```javascript
// Client B
client.presence.getAll((clients) => {
    // [ 'Alex', 'Ben', 'Charlie' ]
})
```
